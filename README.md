# project-bubba

Project Bubba is an iOS application for nonverbal communication that connects to a MetaMotionC sensor. It is currently located in the StarterProject folder.

## Requirements

- Xcode 13.0
- Device running iOS 14.0 or later with Bluetooth 4.0/5.0 (iOS 13+, XCODE12+, BLE5.0 recommended)
REQUIREMENT NOTES
The iOS simulator doesnâ€™t support Bluetooth 4.0/5.0, so test apps must be run on a real iOS device which requires a developer account. This app was built/has constraints for an iPad Pro (12.9 inch).


## Installation

Download project-bubba github files at https://github.com/jpkenzie96/project-bubba.git
